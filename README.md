# hermes

A Grade 34 Bureaucrat to help you create and manage repetitive, multi-file
tasks and experiments.

Hermes is a lightweight templating engine for _directories_. If you have a task
that involves copying whole directories, modifying a few lines in a few files,
and hitting `run`, Hermes can help automate this task and make sure you don't
miss anything.

Hermes can be useful for

- Cosmological simulations (that's what I'm using it for!)
- Machine learning experiments
- and more?
